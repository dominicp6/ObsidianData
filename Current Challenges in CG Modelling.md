1. Basis Set
The accuracy of the CG model depend upon the adequacy of the basis set. Bottom-up CG methods typically approximate the PMF with molecular mechanics potentials that have proven suitable for liquids and polymers, but that may be inadequate for more complex biomolecular systems. 

Although MM potentials are well-suited for atomistic models, they may not always be suitable for CG models. Bottom-up approaches may greatly benefit from considering more complex potential terms to model, e.g. hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic interactions, solvation forces and anisotropic interactions. 

2. Mapping
"Better" mappings offer "simpler" descriptions of the physics, but finding the "best" mapping is far from trivial. 

The mapping influences the "friction" and non-Markovian "memory" that arise when an atomistic trajectory is observed from the CG perspective.

Can one optimise the mapping to improve agreement with dynamical correlation functions? Here are some references that go into this discussion:

3. Thermodynamics
Can one systematically optimise the mapping to enhance the fidelity of thermodynamic properties and minimise the sensitivity of the PMF to the thermodynamic state point of the system?
