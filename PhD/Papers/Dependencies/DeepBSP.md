DeepBSP is a machine learning model that predicts the root mean square deviation (rmsd) of a ligand docking pose with reference to its native binding pose.

DeepBSP is useful in generating and ranking profiles close to their respective native structures, and it can be used to pick out poses close to their natives from many poses generated from a docking application.

The model is trained on decoy structural information, which allows it to distinguish the native structure from docked decoy poses.

It is a significant improvement over traditional scoring functions but does not perform as well as [[AQDnet Deep Neural Net for Protein-Ligand Docking Simulation]].
