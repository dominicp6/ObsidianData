MBIS (Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder) is a computational method used to partition the electron density of a molecule into atomic contributions.

The method is a variant of the [[Hirshfeld AIM partitioning scheme]] and is designed to be computationally efficient.

MBIS is used to calculate atomic charges and other properties of molecules, which can be used in force-field development and other molecular modeling applications.

The method is particularly useful in describing the [[Penetration effect]], which is the deviation of interatomic electrostatic interactions from the Coulombic model.

In MBIS, an electronic force field is defined through a concise approximation of the electron density, for which the Coulomb interaction is trivially evaluated. 

The approximate "pro-density" is expanded in a minimal basis of atom-centred s-type Slater density functions, optimised by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
