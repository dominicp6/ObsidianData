Equivariant GVP-GNNs are a subtype of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) that are designed to be equivariant to rotations and translations.

GVP-GNNs use the Geometric Vector Perceptron (GVP) as the core module of the network, which is a rotation-equivariant neural network that can learn from biomolecular structures.Â 

The GVP-GNNs update both the node embeddings and the node coordinates in the graph, with the node embeddings representing the features of each node and the node coordinates representing the position of each node in space.
