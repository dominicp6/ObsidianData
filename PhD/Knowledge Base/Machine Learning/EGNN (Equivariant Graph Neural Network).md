[Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09844.pdf) are a type of graph neural network that are designed to be equivariant to certain transformations, such as rotations, translations, reflections, and permutations.Â In other words, applying a transformation to the input graph will result in a corresponding transformation to the output of the network. EGNNs are useful for tasks where the output should be invariant to certain transformations, such as predicting the quality of a protein structural model.

EGNNs have been shown to outperform standard graph neural networks on tasks that require equivariance, such as predicting the quality of protein structural models.
