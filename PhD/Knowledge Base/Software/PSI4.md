[PSI4](https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/introduction.html) is an open-source quantum chemistry software package that provides a wide variety of quantum chemical methods using state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms.

The software is designed to be modular and easily extendable by standalone community projects in its growing software ecosystem.

The basic capabilities of PSI4 are concentrated around the following methods of quantum chemistry: Hartree–Fock method, density functional theory, and Møller–Plesset perturbation.
