DES5M is a benchmark database of dimer interaction energies that contains nearly 5 million unique geometries.

For every dimer included in DES5M, the interaction energy was computed using the [[SNS-MP2 approach]], which provides results with accuracy comparable to that of coupled-cluster training data.

The DES5M dataset may prove useful in the development of density functionals, empirically corrected wavefunction-based approaches, semi-empirical methods, force fields, and models trained using machine learning methods.
