[PDBbind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDBbind_database) is a database that provides a comprehensive collection of experimentally measured binding affinity data for all types of biomolecular complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

The aim of the PDBbind database is to provide a linkage between energetic and structural information of these complexes, which may be used for various studies on molecular recognition occurred in biological systems.

The PDBbind database was first released to the public in May 2004 and is updated on an annual basis to keep up with the growth of the Protein Data Bank.

The PDBbind database provides two basic types of information: refined set and core set, which are compiled as high-quality data sets of protein-ligand complexes for docking/scoring.
