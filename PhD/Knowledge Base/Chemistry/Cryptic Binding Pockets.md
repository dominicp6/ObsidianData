Cryptic binding pockets are sites on protein targets that only become apparent when drugs bind. These pockets are not readily visible in the unbound protein structure and can only be detected in the presence of a bound ligand.

**Apo vs Holo Structure**
Apo structure is a term used to describe the structure of a protein in its inactive, unbound state. It is the structure of the protein without any ligands bound to it. The term "apo" is derived from the Greek word "apo" meaning "away from" or "separate from". The apo structure is important in understanding the conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding, as it provides a baseline for comparison with the holo structure, which is the structure of the protein with a ligand bound to it.

**Conformational selection vs induced fit**
The former mechanism implies that the ligand’s role is to stabilise specific conformations that are also accessible in the unbound state. The latter mechanism proposes that the ligand causes the target to explore regions of the conformational space that are practically inaccessible to he unbound form.

There is still some uncertainty as to the leading mechanism for the formation of cryptic binding pockets. From the experimental point of view, only kinetic experiments might provide a clear distinction of the two mechanisms, as the binding rate in the case of conformational selection is dependent on the concentration of the ligand, while for the induced fit it is not.
