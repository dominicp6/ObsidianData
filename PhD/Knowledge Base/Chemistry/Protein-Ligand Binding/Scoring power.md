"Scoring power" refers to the ability of a scoring function to produce binding scores in a linear correlation with experimental binding data. 

It is quantified through a Pearson's correlation coefficient (and its SD) between the computed binding scores and the experimental binding constants (in units $\log K_a$ ).
