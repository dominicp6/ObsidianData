CASF-2016 stands for **C**omparative **A**ssessment of **S**coring **F**unctions 2016. 

It is a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of [[Scoring Functions (Protein-Ligand Docking)]].

Each scoring function is evaluated by four metrics, including "[[Scoring power]]", "[[Ranking power]]", "[[Docking power]]", and "[[Screening power]]".

The results obtained on CASF-2016 may provide valuable guidance for the end-users to make smart choices among available scoring functions.
