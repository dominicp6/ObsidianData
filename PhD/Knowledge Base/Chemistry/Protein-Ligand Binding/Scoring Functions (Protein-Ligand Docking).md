In structure-based drug design, a scoring function refers to a family of computational methods used to quantify protein-ligand interaction. 

They aim to achieve a compromise between speed and accuracy by making various approximations, which makes them suitable for high-throughput tasks.

They are used in molecular docking to rank hundreds of putative ligand binding poses and select favourable ones. 

There are four main categories:
1) Physics-based methods
2) Empirical scoring functions
3) Knowledge-based statistical potentials
4) Descriptor-based machine-learning scoring functions
