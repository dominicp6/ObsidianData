"Screening power" refers to the ability of a scoring function to identify true binders to a given target protein among a pool of random molecules.

One way to quantify is identifying the success rate of identifying the highesr-affinity binder among the 1%, 5% or 10% top-ranked ligands over a set of target proteins.
