Becke-Johnson damping is a method used in density functional theory (DFT) calculations to correct for the overestimation of long-range interactions in standard DFT functionals.

The method involves the use of a damping function that scales the exchange-correlation potential in the long-range region, a rational function that approaches unity as the interatomic distance approaches zero and approaches zero as the interatomic distance approaches infinity.
