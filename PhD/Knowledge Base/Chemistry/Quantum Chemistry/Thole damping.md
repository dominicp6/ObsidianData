[Thole damping](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0301010481851762) is a method used to describe the polarizability of molecules in molecular simulations. The method involves the use of a damping function that scales the induced dipole moment in the long-range region. The Thole damping parameter is usually set to a value of 2.6, but in certain force fields, the value can depend on the atom types.

Both the induced dipole and [Drude oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drude_oscillator) approaches benefit from short-range Thole damping to avoid a polarization catastrophe. 

The Thole damping parameters were set by optimizing the molecular polarizabilities for a set of 16 molecule.
