Multipole-multipole interaction coefficients are coefficients that describe the interaction between two molecules based on their multipole moments.

The coefficients are used to calculate the interaction energy between the two molecules, which is important in understanding intermolecular interactions, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding.

Typically they are calculated using quantum mechanical methods, such as density functional theory or [[coupled-cluster theory]].
