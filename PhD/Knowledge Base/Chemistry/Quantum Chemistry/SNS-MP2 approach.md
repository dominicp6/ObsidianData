The SNS-MP2 (Spin-Network-Scaled MP2) approach is a semi-empirical method for computing dimer interaction energies in molecular systems.

The method is based on the MÃ¸ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and uses neural networks to improve the accuracy of the interaction energy predictions.

he method is widely used in molecular modeling applications, including force-field development, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum chemistry calculations.

The SNS-MP2 approach is implemented in various software packages, including [[PSI4]].
