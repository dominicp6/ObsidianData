RESP (Restrained Electrostatic Potential is a method for assigning partial charges to molecules for use in molecular simulations.

The method fits the quantum mechanically calculated molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) at molecular surfaces.

The goal of the method is to assign partial charges that reproduce the MEP as closely as possible.

The method is widely used in molecular dynamics simulations and is implemented in various software packages, including AMBER.
