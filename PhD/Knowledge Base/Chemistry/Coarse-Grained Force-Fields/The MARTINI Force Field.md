The force field maps four heavy atoms to one coarse-grained interaction site and is parameterized with the aim of reproducing thermodynamic properties.

The MARTINI force field has been used to study a wide variety of biomolecular systems, including lipid bilayers, proteins, and nucleic acids. It has been shown to be accurate and efficient, and it is one of the most popular coarse-grained force fields in the field of molecular dynamics simulations.
