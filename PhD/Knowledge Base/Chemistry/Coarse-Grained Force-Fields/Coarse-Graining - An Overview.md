[[Bottom-up Coarse Graining]] models a particular system on the basis of a more detailed model for the same system. Often, bottom-up models are constructed on the basis of a classical atomistic model that provides an empirical, but highly optimised, approximation to the fundamental model.

Top-down Coarse Graining models are related to the real system by addressing phenomena that are experimentally observed on length scales that are accessible to the CG model.

Physics-based approaches employ physical theories to infer the interactions in CG models, typically either via bottom-up strategies that address more detailed models or via top-down strategies that address less detailed observables.

In contrast, knowledge-based models are constructed on the basis of information extracted from experimentally determined three-dimensional structures. Knowledge-based approaches typically employ empirical relations to determine the interactions in CG models (or scoring functions for bioinformatic calculations), especially in the context of structure prediction and computational protein engineering.

Increasingly, these distinctions are becoming blurred. [[Native structure-based models]] are an example.
