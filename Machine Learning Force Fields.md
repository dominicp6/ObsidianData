Minimal basis iterable stockholder.
A technique for estimating atomic partial charges, derived from an electronic wave function more robust than RESP. Only spherically symmetric models for atoms are considered. It works by minimising the KL divergence of an expansion of atom-centred s-type Slater functions from a given molecular electron density. Related to the Hirshfeld method based on information theory.

RESP
Restrained electrostatic potential.


AIM
Atoms in Molecules.
Any method that partitions the molecular electron density into atomic contributions, from which e.g. atomic multipole moments can be derived.
